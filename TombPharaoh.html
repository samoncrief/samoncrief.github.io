            <p>In my last semester at University of Miami, I had an "Intro to Game Programming" course. I was pleasantly surprised going in to find that the course was focused on programming in C# for the Unity Engine, an environment I had prior experience with. The examples and assignments for the course were focused around building a 2D platformer, so I decided to make a 2D platformer, something I had never really tried in Unity. Being a sucker for Ancient Egyptian stuff, I decided to theme the game around a sort of off-brand Indiana Jones character exploring a tomb.</p>

            <p>The game turned out fairly well, I must say! The main hazards the player must contend with are pits leading to a deadly drop off the screen, poison darts firing out of the walls, and mummies patrolling sections of the tomb. Past the usual running and jumping, the character has another tool to deal with problems: When the player presses the space bar while standing or jumping, the character will strike the area in front of them with a whip! Whipping can destroy incoming poison darts and push back mummies. The character's lives are tied to how many coins they have collected in the levels they have completed. When the character dies, the player can spend a coin to retry the level; if the character dies with no coins remaining, that is game over! When I showed off my work at the end of the semester, the instructor was rather impressed! That said, I must admit I probably made some of the jumps too difficult, the darts too hard to see in a browser window, and the later sections with two sets of dart shooters are really difficult. Overall, I'm happy with what I produced.</p>
