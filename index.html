              <p class="subtitle section-black">My name is Steven Moncrief, and I'm a software developer with a focus on creating interactive experiences. I have significant experience in iOS app development with Swift and game development with the Unity Engine. As a developer, I would say that I'm most at home when I can sit down to a project with a set of clear goals and produce something great. That said, I look at moving out of my comfort zone as an opportunity to learn new technologies and techniques. My journey as a developer has only just started, and I can't wait to see what lies past the horizon.</p>
              <p class="subtitle section-black">User-facing experiences present a unique kind of challenge in software development: Beyond the binary question of "Does it work?", such projects must also be optimized to work well in human hands. It is this human element that I find appealing as a developer.</p>

        <h1 class="title section-black has-text-weight-bold">About Me</h1>
        <p class="subtitle section-black">I started off my journey in software development as a kid who liked video games and wanted to understand how they worked. I must credit my father for introducing me to gaming, and by extension starting me down my eventual path. Math came easier to me than other subjects growing up, so I decided programming would be the best course of study given my interests. I would go on to graduate from the University of Miami in 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Along the way, I was even able to please my inner child and make a few games!</p>
        <p class="subtitle section-black">I still love games, but my attitude matured into something broader: Instead of just wanting to make something I liked, I want to make things that give other people the same kind of satisfaction I got out of playing games as a kid.</p>
