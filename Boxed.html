        <p>As part of a university course, I was tasked with creating an interactive experience using the p5.js library plus one related library of my choice. Naturally, I used this opportunity to make a game. The result of this project: Boxed!</p>
        <p>Boxed! is a simple game: move the mouse cursor to direct the green box around the screen in order to avoid obstacles. Using a procedural generation structure of my own design, the level is generated on the fly! The player's score is a direct measure of how long they were able to keep going through the level.</p>

            <p>CHANGELOG</p>
            <ul>
                <li>March 2020: After some time away from this game, I felt it could use a few tweaks. The space between each row of obstacles is halved to add a bit more of a challenge. I've also added red boxes to make the game a little less repetitive, both in visuals and gameplay. Finally, the red line across the bottom is now part of a red box that goes around the screen. Boxes all the way down!</li>
